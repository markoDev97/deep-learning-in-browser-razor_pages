This web application is a university project for image classification using images taken from the computer camera and using deep learning 
as a classification approach.

There are two main web pages besides the index page: page for filling the dataset and page for model training and classification.

In order to fill the dataset, one must first take a photo with the computer camera and then enter a class label; all necessary data is 
appropriately stored after this.

In order to train the model, one should enter learning rate, number of epochs and then deep learning framework/library. After training, one
can classify unseen images which are not stored in the dataset.
